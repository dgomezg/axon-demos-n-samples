# Shopping Cart Service 

This project contains the Shopping Cart Service implemented with AxonFramework using Spring-boot. 
The `ShoppingCart` defines several `@CommandHandlers` to change the ShoppingCart state.

To run the project, locate the `ShoppingCartServiceApplication` and run it from your IDE.

> [!NOTE]  
This service will try to connect to an Axon Server instance, as described in [Shopping Cart root project](../).
> You can read how to easily run an instance in the `Running Axon Server` section of parent's project.
